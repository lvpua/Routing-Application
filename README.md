# Routing Application in Python
 Class project for Data Structures and Algorithms 2


SCENARIO:

For this assessment, you will apply the algorithms and data structures you studied in this course to solve a real programming problem. You will also implement an algorithm to route delivery trucks that will allow you to meet all delivery constraints while traveling under 140 miles. You will then describe and justify the decisions you made while creating this program.

The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day. Each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.


Your task is to determine an algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages will be delivered on time while meeting each package’s requirements and keeping the combined total distance traveled under 140 miles for both trucks. The specific delivery locations are shown on the attached “Salt Lake City Downtown Map,” and distances to each location are given in the attached “WGUPS Distance Table.” The intent is to use the program for this specific location and also for many other cities in each state where WGU has a presence. As such, you will need to include detailed comments to make your code easy to follow and to justify the decisions you made while writing your scripts.
